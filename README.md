# Comparative Study of Energy Efficient Protocols in Wireless Sensor Network
In this project, we repeated the simulations of commonly used energy efficient WSN protocols which are out there such as Low Energy Adaptive Hierarchical (LEACH) Protocol and Stable Election Protocol(SEP), Energy Aware Multi-hop Multi-path Hierarchical Routing Protocol (EAMMH). These two protocols are widely used in WSN, apart from this we also came across Threshold Sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network(TEEN), which outperforms LEACH,SEP and EAMMH in terms of stability and lifetime for a node in WSN.
